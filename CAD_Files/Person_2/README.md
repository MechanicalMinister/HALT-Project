# Person 2 - CAD Files

This is your personal workspace for CAD design work.

## Organization Tips
- Create subdirectories for each project
- Use descriptive names with dates
- Document your design decisions

## Example Structure
```
Person_2/
├── Project_A/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── design_notes.txt
│   └── [CAD files - not tracked by Git]
└── Project_B/
    ├── README.md
    └── [CAD files - not tracked by Git]
```

## When Ready to Share
Move finalized CAD files to `../Shared/` for team review.
