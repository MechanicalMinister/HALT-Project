# Person 3 - FEM Analysis

This is your personal workspace for FEM analysis work.

## Organization Tips
- Create subdirectories for each analysis project
- Document boundary conditions and assumptions
- Export result summaries (PDF, images) for version control
- Large result files are automatically ignored by Git

## Example Structure
```
Person_3/
├── Analysis_A/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── analysis_setup.txt
│   ├── results_summary.pdf
│   ├── stress_plot.png
│   └── [Large result files - not tracked by Git]
└── Analysis_B/
    ├── README.md
    └── [Analysis files]
```

## FEM Software
Document which software and version you're using:
- ANSYS
- Abaqus
- LS-DYNA
- Other

## When Ready to Share
Move final analysis reports to `../Shared/` for team review.
